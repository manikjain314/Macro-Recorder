# Macro-Recorder
Record/playback macros to easily automate monotonous tasks!

As of now, there is no functionality to stop playback of macros via keypress. The way to do it as of now is to move your mouse to the top left of your screen. I will try to make it via keypress later.

Default commands:
- Start recording macro: DEL
- Stop recording macro: ESC
- Playback macro: F6

Trigger keys can be altered via the config.txt file.
